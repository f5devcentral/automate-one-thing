# Automate One Thing (A1T)
Automate One Thing (A1T) is an initiative to help F5 customers to start using automation to tackle business impacting tasks.

The initiative consists of:
 - Workshops
 - Labs
 - Examples

# Workshops
A1T workshops are delivered by F5 Solutions Engineers and Solutions Architects to help customers automate a business-impacting task in a non-production environment.  A workshop's outcome is a solution the customer can take into production and show immediate benefits to their company.

We deliver A1T workshops in an agile fashion with a 2-day sprint.  The workshop starts with the customer and F5 teams identifying the resources and tools needed. Then the teams break the defined pain point into user stories and tasks. 

F5 offers both sales and professional service A1T workshops based on the customer's needs and requirements. 

# labs
A1T labs are self-paced training sessions to help F5 customers and engineers learn automation tooling used by F5 to deploy and configure F5 products in public and private cloud environments.  The labs run in F5's Unified Demo Framework, or they can easily be adapted to run in a customer's lab environment. 

If you would like access to the F5 Unified Demo Framework to run a lab, please contact your F5 account team. 

# Examples
A1T examples help demonstrate everyday automation tasks customers experience.  These tasks can be anything from adding/removing pool members to rotating TLS certificates.
